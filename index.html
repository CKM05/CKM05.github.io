<h1> Soccer </h1>
<h3> Player Positions </h3>
<p> In soccer, there are four main positions: forward, midfield, defense, and goalie. Forwards play up top, meaning higher than the 

other players, they are the main goal-scorers. Midfielders are the players who run the most in the game. They are both offenders and 

defenders, meaning they both defend the goal and score goals. This means that they need to run up and down the field to help defense 

and to help the offense. Defenders are the players who stay behind and protect their part of the field. They keep the ball away from 

the offenders from the other team trying to score. Lastly, the goalie is a very important person in the game in my opinion. The goalie 

stays behind everyone and stands in the goal and  tries to keep the ball out of the ball, this is the only player that can use their hands. 

</p>
<h3> Field Setup </h3>
<p> The field is in the shape of a rectangle, with goals on each end. In the middle of the field, there is a line that splits the field in half. 

In the middle of the line is a circle split in half by the line. Back surrounding the goals is a rectangle. Outside surrounding this rectangle 

is a larger rectangle. Just outside this larger rectangle, in the middle, is a small semi-circle. These rectangles make up the goalie box.

<h3> Offsides </h3>

<p>  Offsides is when players are on the opponents end of the field try to pass near the goal when the player they are passing to has 

no defender in front of them. This is a fault that many players make.This can result in a goal kick, a free kick, etc. </p>
<h3> Fouls </h3
<p> Fouls can cause goal kicks, free kicks, etc. A foul is when one player harms a player. Such as: if a player kicks the other, trips the 

other, etc.

<h3> Hand ball </h3>
<p> A hand ball is just what it sounds like: when a player touches the ball with their hands. Because you play this sport with anything 

but your hands this would also, as well as the others, result in a goal kick, free kick, etc.
<h2> Penalties </h2>
<h3> Free kick </h3>
<p> A free kick is when a player makes a foul, hand ball, or offsides. This usually happens when the penalty is in the middle, not really 

by any edges or out of bounds line. Wherever the foul is made, they set the ball there and the player has a chance to kick the ball 

without any pressure to any player he or she chooses. 
<h3> Goal kick </h3>
<p> This may not be the proper name for this kick, but whenever the player fouls near the goal or in the goalies box, the team that has 

been fouled is allowed to have a free shot at the goal. The other players are not allowed to interefere with the player shooting. The 

only player allowed to interfere is the goalie. </p>
<h1>FIFA </h1>
<p> FIFA is an important event. Its sort of like the olympics and super bowl mixed together. Each country picks players for their team 

and countries from all over go to one location, for instance, this year they all came to Brazil. They all compete against each other for 

the Trophy, or the World Cup. </p>
